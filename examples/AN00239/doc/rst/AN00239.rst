Overview

Introduction
............

This application note shows how to use the logging library. It covers the
difference between the logging library (``debug_printf()``) and the system library
printing function (``printf()``).

It also covers the difference between JTAG and xSCOPE to perform the I/O to the
host, including approximate values for resource usage and performance of each approach.

Example logging library usage
-----------------------------

The Makefile
............

The logging library needs to be added to the ``USED_MODULES`` line
of your Makefile::

  USED_MODULES = .. lib_logging ..

Also, ``debug_printf()`` calls are only active if you enable
them in your Makefile. This is done by by setting ``DEBUG_PRINT_ENABLE``
to 1 in the ``XCC_FLAGS``::

  XCC_FLAGS += -DDEBUG_PRINT_ENABLE=1

Include
.......

The function prototypes are declared in a single header file which must
be included from your source file::

  #include "debug_print.h"

Using the logging library
.........................

The logging library provides the ``debug_printf()`` function. The function has
the same form as a standard ``printf()``, but only supports a subset of formats -
namely the %d, %x, %s, %u, %p and %c format specifiers with no conversions.

The example application outputs "Hello world".

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-after: main(
   :end-on: debug_printf(

Debug units
...........

Applications can be created with different *units* whose debug output is independently
controlled. The example application also calls a function in another unit:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-after: debug_printf(
   :end-on: unit_function(

That file has put its debug messages as a separate debug unit by doing:

.. literalinclude:: unit.xc
   :start-on: define
   :end-on: include

And by default these debug messages are not enabled, so running the program
will only produce the following output::

  $ xrun --xscope bin/AN00239.xe
  Hello world

In order to enable the debug_print messages in ``unit.xc`` it is necessary to
add the following to the Makefile (uncomment the line)::

  XCC_FLAGS += -DDEBUG_PRINT_ENABLE_unit=1

After rebuilding the application it will now produce::

  $ xrun --xscope bin/AN00239.xe
  Hello world
  Unit print

xSCOPE printing
...............

On the xCORE platform it is possible to have I/O messages sent to the
console using either JTAG or xSCOPE. The default is for JTAG to be used. However,
when doing I/O over JTAG all cores on the xCORE are stopped and hence
realtime functionality is no longer maintained. As a result xSCOPE I/O should
be preferred.

xSCOPE I/O is enabled by creating a ``config.xscope`` file. This file can be
created in the same folder as the Makefile or with the source files. When
``config.xscope`` exists, it controls whether I/O messages are enabled, and
whether they use xSCOPE or JTAG. A basic file which enables I/O over xSCOPE
contains::

  <xSCOPEconfig ioMode="basic" enabled="true">
  </xSCOPEconfig>

Notes
-----

Resource usage
..............

The following table shows the memory and cycle requirements for doing
a simple print of "Hello world %d\\n", using either ``printf()`` or ``debug_printf()``,
and using either JTAG or xSCOPE as the transport to the host.

.. list-table:: Resource usage
 :header-rows: 1

 * - Function
   - Transport
   - Program Memory (kB)
   - Time (us)
 * - None
   - N/A
   - 0.9
   - 0.0
 * - debug_printf()
   - JTAG
   - 1.86
   - 72000
 * - debug_printf()
   - xSCOPE
   - 2.88
   - 8.5
 * - printf()
   - JTAG
   - 9.02
   - 72000
 * - printf()
   - xSCOPE
   - 9.99
   - 18.6

.. note:: The JTAG timings are approximate and will depend on a number of factors
          including the host machine being used.

Lossless vs lossy
.................

The advantage of using xSCOPE instead of JTAG should be clear from the performance
figures above. However, it is important to understand that xSCOPE is a lossy
transport and as such if too much I/O is created then messages can be lost.

Ordering
........

It is also essential to understand that messages produced by different
logical cores are interleaved on the host console. There is no guarantee of the
order in which they will be printed.

print.h
.......

The tools provide extreemly lightweight printing functions in ``print.h``. For
example it is possible to do::

  #include <print.h>
  ...
  printstr("The number ");
  printint(10);
  printstrln(" should be 10");

But each of these print fragments can arrive mixed with messages from
other logical cores. Whereas::

  debug_printf("The number %d should be 10\n", 10);

will be printed as a single line.
